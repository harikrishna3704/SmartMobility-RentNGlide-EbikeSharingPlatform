# SmartMobility-RentNGlide-EbikeSharingPlatform

🧾 Overview
Rent N’Glide is a community-driven electric bike rental platform that connects local riders with electric bike owners for affordable and eco-friendly commuting. Built as part of our System Analysis and Project Management course at The University of Texas at Dallas, the platform is designed to improve short-distance transportation while promoting sustainable practices and community collaboration.

This repository outlines the project problem, objectives, models, diagrams, technical specs, and more.

Enable real-time bike availability tracking across various localities.

Facilitate a secure and smooth payment process for both renters and bike owners.

Encourage responsible riding behavior by introducing a reward-based system.

Empower bike owners to monetize idle assets, fostering community-based shared mobility.
