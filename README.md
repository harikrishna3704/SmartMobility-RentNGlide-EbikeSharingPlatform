# SmartMobility-RentNGlide-EbikeSharingPlatform

**🧾 **Overview****

Rent N’Glide is a community-driven electric bike rental platform that connects local riders with electric bike owners for affordable and eco-friendly commuting. Built as part of our System Analysis and Project Management course at The University of Texas at Dallas, the platform is designed to improve short-distance transportation while promoting sustainable practices and community collaboration.

This repository outlines the project problem, objectives, models, diagrams, technical specs, and more.

**🎯 Objectives**

* Develop a user-friendly interface (web/app) for seamless renting and listing of electric bikes.
* Enable real-time bike availability tracking across various localities.
* Facilitate a secure and smooth payment process for both renters and bike owners.
* Encourage responsible riding behavior by introducing a reward-based system.
* Empower bike owners to monetize idle assets, fostering community-based shared mobility.

**🛠 Technologies Used**

1. Microsoft Excel – Data dictionary & early planning
2. Lucidchart / Draw.io – Diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, Context, BPMN
3. PowerPoint – Prototyping UI flows
4. UML Modeling – Use Case, Sequence, Class diagrams
5. Database – ER Diagram and Class-based DB Design
